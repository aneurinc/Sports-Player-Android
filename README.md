# Sports Player - Android - Kotlin

This repo is a demonstration of how to implement Clean Architecture for Android. It is an adaption/extension of Fernando Cejas' [Android-CleanArchitecture-Kotlin](https://github.com/android10/Android-CleanArchitecture-Kotlin) project. The app displays profiles and videos of some of the world's top athletes. It is written in Kotlin and takes advantage of language features, such as coroutines and functional programming techniques.
